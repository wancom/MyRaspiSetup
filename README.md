# My RaspberryPi Setup

This is my favorite RaspberryPi setup tools.  
- Power Status LED control
    When the system is starting, red LED blinking.
    The system is started, red LED is flashing once 5 sec.
    When the system is shutdown, red LED is turned on and not blinking.

- Power Checker
    When the system is started or going to shutdown, run on/off commands i.e. sending e-mail.
    When the system is started, the power checker checks last status and if the last shutdown is not normal, run error commands i.e. sending e-mail.
